boto3-refresh-session
---------------------

A simple Python package for refreshing the temporary security credentials in a :class:`boto3.session.Session` object automatically.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python
   
   import boto3_refresh_session as brs

   # you can pass all of the params associated with boto3.session.Session
   profile_name = '<your-profile-name>'
   region_name = 'us-east-1'
   ...

   # as well as all of the params associated with STS.Client.assume_role
   assume_role_kwargs = {
       'RoleArn': '<your-role-arn>',
       'RoleSessionName': '<your-role-session-name>',
       'DurationSeconds': '<your-selection>',
       ...
   }

   # as well as all of the params associated with STS.Client, except for 'service_name'
   sts_client_kwargs = {
      'region_name': region_name,
      ...
   }

   # initialize boto3.session.Session
   session = brs.RefreshableSession(
      assume_role_kwargs=assume_role_kwargs, # required
      sts_client_kwargs=sts_client_kwargs,
      region_name=region_name,
      profile_name=profile_name,
   )

   # now you can create clients, resources, etc. without worrying about expired temporary security credentials
   s3 = session.client(service_name='s3')
   buckets = s3.list_buckets()

Raison d'Ãªtre
-------------

It is common for data pipelines and workflows that interact with the AWS API via 
``boto3`` to run for a long time and, accordingly, for temporary credentials to 
expire. 

Usually, engineers deal with that problem one of two ways: 

- ``try except`` blocks that catch ``ClientError`` exceptions
- A similar approach as that used in this project -- that is, using methods available 
  within ``botocore`` for refreshing temporary credentials automatically. 
  
Speaking personally, variations of the code found herein exists in code bases at 
nearly every company where I have worked. Sometimes, I turned that code into a module; 
other times, I wrote it from scratch. Clearly, that is inefficient.

I decided to finally turn that code into a proper Python package with unit testing, 
automatic documentation, and quality checks; the idea being that, henceforth, depending 
on my employer's open source policy, I may simply import this package instead of 
reproducing the code herein for the Nth time.

If any of that sounds relatable, then ``boto3-refresh-session`` should help you.
