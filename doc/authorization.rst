Authorization
*************

In order to use this package, it is **recommended** that you follow one of the
below methods for authorizing access to your AWS instance:

- Create local environment variables containing your credentials, 
  e.g. ``ACCESS_KEY``, ``SECRET_KEY``, and ``SESSION_TOKEN``.
- Create a shared credentials file, i.e. ``~/.aws/credentials``.
- Create an AWS config file, i.e. ``~/.aws/config``.
